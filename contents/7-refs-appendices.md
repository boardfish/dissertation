| 6  | We have a loyalty program because we change the story and in our room often. Wouldn't reccommend for a place that doesn't. In terms of Metrics - we tell people the success rate of the room but not of individual puzzles. We try and push people into bigger groups but if someone doesn't want to play with strangers we let them move to a different room or time. |

| 2  | This was a completely useless survey from an owner standpoint. Only conclusion is that you are deciding to apply tech to completely trivial features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6  | We strictly limit/eliminate the use of tech for 2 reasons. 1st is reliability. If a critical game prop breaks and requires an electrician or computer programer then I am losing revenue on that game. 2nd is since we change our rooms, we do not invest as much into props unless they can be re-used in another game or another room. Each room only lasts 1-1 1/2 years so there is no point on investing in something flashy. |
