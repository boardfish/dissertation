# Conclusion

<!--
The conclusions can be summarised in a fairly short chapter (2 or 3 pages). This chapter brings together many of the points that you will have made in other chapters, especially in the previous results and discussion chapter. Do not be afraid of repeating some of your earlier statements here, albeit using different wording.

The escape room industry is wary in its use of technology, making a priority of
stability. For that reason, it is difficult to develop technology for use inside
the escape room itself. By investigating the needs of the escape room community,
I developed a social network that meets needs expressed by maintainers and
suggested by enthusiasts.

I did this through thorough application of industry practices such as use of
Kanban and automated testing. The result is a secured and usable web application
using Ruby on Rails and React. This was able to meet the basic requirements, but
I believe that with more time available, I might have been able to give it
enough features for it to be a fully compelling product in its own right.
