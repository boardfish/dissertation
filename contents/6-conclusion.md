# Conclusion

<!--
The conclusions can be summarised in a fairly short chapter (2 or 3 pages). This chapter brings together many of the points that you will have made in other chapters, especially in the previous results and discussion chapter. Do not be afraid of repeating some of your earlier statements here, albeit using different wording.

The escape room industry is wary in its use of technology, making a priority of
stability. The experience delivered by escape rooms regularly relies on the
physical, as opposed to the digital, in order to build excitement and immersion.
For those reasons, it is difficult to develop technology for use inside the
escape room itself. This was explored in the literature review.

The needs of escape room maintainers, both internally to the
escape room experience and externally of the community, were investigated. This
concluded in a decision to build a social network, which both allowed
maintainers to advertise among other escape rooms and share photos. Enthusiasts
would also gain a captivating experience and useful tool in the pursuit of new
rooms to tackle.

The product of this was Blacklight, a responsive web application that meets
needs expressed by maintainers and suggested by enthusiasts. Blacklight was
engineered through thorough application of industry practices such as use of
Kanban and automated testing, with some allowances made for time constraints.
The result is a secured and usable web application using Ruby on Rails and
React.

This was able to meet the basic requirements, but I believe that with
more time available, I might have been able to give it enough features for it to
be a fully compelling product in its own right. Should Blacklight be able to go
public, there is more than enough room for it to grow as a platform, but these
uncertain times seem to dictate its fate more than anything else.
