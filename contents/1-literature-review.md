# Literature Survey

## Process
<!-- TODO: how did you go about the lit review? it was a mini-project of its own, after all -->

### Keywords

I identified the following keywords for use in my search. The search was
conducted using the Google Scholar search engine.

- escape room / puzzle hunt
- maintainer / owner / host
- implementation
- software
- virtual reality
- education / classroom

This led to the following searches.

- escape room owner
- escape room host
- escape room maintainer
- escape room software
- escape room education
- escape room classroom
- virtual reality escape room
- portable escape room

Additional searches were made based on discoveries such as escapED
[@clarke2016escaped] and Breakout EDU @breakoutedu to see where they had been
applied.

## Survey

Escape rooms are run both by enthusiasts as solo ventures, and as
franchises across the country. Nicholson [-@nicholson2015peeking] documents
escape rooms as the culmination of a variety of media. He identifies
puzzle hunts as team-based problem-solving challenges<!-- TODO: is this a quote?
-->, which, with treasure hunts, appears most similar to escape rooms. Various
others have lent features to escape rooms, such as immersion in a story as the
"hero", which @duplessie2013go reports as being something enthusiasts enjoy.
This is embodied by live-action roleplaying, another inspiration for the genre
[@nicholson2015peeking]. Nicholson presents the precursors to escape rooms in
further depth in his paper - Figure 2.1 summarises these.

Escape rooms have grown popular in many locations across the world as a
recreational activity [@nicholson2015peeking; @stasiak2016escape], even serving
as a tourist attraction [@dilek2018real]. Nicholson reports that the *Real
Escape Game* by SCRAP was the earliest well-documented activity branded as such.
SCRAP has gone on to develop escape rooms at a much larger scale than the
typical escape room, which serves teams of an average size of 4.58 people
[@nicholson2015peeking].

Escape room maintainers are able to apply technology to varying degrees. On the
outside of the escape room experience, maintainers implement leaderboards, share
team photos to social media, and interact with the team via a screen or handheld
transceiver in the room. Inside the room, entire puzzles can be based on
technology, if the maintainer has the necessary expertise. Some more unique
applications within the room are also possible, such as using a hidden camera to
take a photo of the team, apply filters, and display the photo among works of
art as demonstrated in *[The Gallery](https://escapist.nl/en/)*, which I visited
in July 2019. However, there is a general aversion to the use of technology in
escape rooms, for a variety of reasons. @liam2019 suggests that the time
investment, reliability, and necessary expertise are some of the greatest
contributing factors. @duplessie2013go approaches this from the perspective of
immersion - with 70% of escape room games being purely physical activities
[@nicholson2015peeking], DuPlessie recommends movement away from what he calls
the "glowing rectangles" as our medium of choice.

The increasing application of IT in education means that computers are often
part of the school environment, and can be used as a tool when building an
escape room experience for educational purposes. Several studies cover the use
of escape rooms as a means for education [@lopezuse; @rouse2017lessons;
@peleg2019lab; @beguin2019computer]. @rouse2017lessons applied technology to an
escape room in the classroom using a game loaded from a memory stick. This
application seems understandable; Rouse's audience was likely to have some basic
level of expertise in, and enthusiasm for, handling computers as part of the
digital native generation. Though never directly stated, they can be assumed to
be under 18. However, in practice, this application brings to mind the image of
a small group of people crowding around a screen. @liam2019 warns against
situations like this, saying that visibility of the puzzle to the entire team
should be a priority. 

<!-- TODO: Reshuffle this paragraph? -->
Poor implementation does not necessarily mean technology should not be excluded
from escape room environments outright. Instead, technology has the potential to
inspire change in escape rooms by targetting the time it takes to reset a room
back into a playable state. Escape rooms and technology are inherently linked -
digital escape-the-room games such as *Myst* precede and inspire physical escape
rooms [@nicholson2015peeking]. In these games, partipicants solve similar
puzzles through digital means, sometimes applying and combining an inventory of
objects to create new tools for use in their escape.

These forms of escape room can be reset instantly by resetting the game. Whether
this is done by restarting an attempt, restarting the game, or removing save
files and starting over, it is often trivial compared to how long it takes to
reset escape rooms. @liam2019 explains that resetting physical escape rooms can
often take as long as 15 minutes, and that it is something escape room
maintainers seek to optimise; the shorter a reset takes, the more time is
available to welcome customers.

Commercial escape rooms are often permanent fixtures. This means that more
immersive environments and more complex physical puzzles can be built. However,
puzzles of a physical nature usually need to be reset by the room maintainer
back to their original state, so that more than one group can attend a room in
the same day. Contrary to this, escape rooms built in a classroom environment
are usually of a temporary nature, and may even try to allow for multiple groups
to attempt the room at once, at the cost of immersion and interactivity. A study
by @lopezuse organised its puzzles in a manner whereby puzzles could be
completed in any order, allowing multiple groups to attend the room at once. One
example puzzle given in the study was an exercise likely done on paper -
exercises in this form make resets trivial, as a fresh worksheet is all that is
necessary, but they also demonstrate the lack of immersion.

Commercial escape rooms regularly employ more physical interaction - 78% of
escape rooms employ a search for physical objects as part of the experience
[@nicholson2015peeking]. Some varieties of commercial escape room visit the
other end of this spectrum, such as those developed by Tuzak, an Istanbul
company developing portable escape games [@gunduz2018preventing]. Portable or
temporary escape games often trade immersion for greater logical challenge.

Application of technology in escape rooms comes with some uncertainty, and a
break in the flow of the escape room experience can shatter participants'
immersion and lead to negative reviews [@liam2019]. This also creates some
difficulty when it comes to visibility - unless monitors are suitably placed and
large enough to be viewed by a full party, the whole team may not be able to
interface with a puzzle that applies technology. This is particularly an issue
if a single typical workstation is set up - @nicholson2015peeking warns of the
danger of removing just one player from the "mental space" of the team.

@liam2019 theorises that VR escape rooms such as *[EXIT
VR](https://exit-vr.de/en/)* may be the next stage for the industry, which allow
immersive rooms to be created while effectively eliminating the issue of
resetting the room as above. This would bring the escape room cycle full circle,
reincarnating the modern wave of physical escape rooms in the digital form that
inspired them.

While the escape room industry cautiously explores the "glowing rectangles"
@duplessie2013go warns against, the video games industry that lent it
inspiration sometimes takes small strides to recede from them. This has resulted
in concepts that escape rooms, and interactive experiences of all kinds, can
learn from. [*Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*](https://keeptalkinggame.com/)
focuses on asynchronous gameplay, in which one player must defuse a bomb while
the others guide them using the [bomb's manual](https://bombmanual.com).
Conceptually, the game shares fundamentals with escape rooms, but what is of
most importance to the point is that the foremost task in the game is
communication. Escape rooms already apply asynchronous gameplay - The Lockup
Escape Rooms' *Meltdown* [@liam2019] begins with most of the party in individual
chambers, with the designated 'leader' communicating from outside - but *Keep
Talking and Nobody Explodes* demonstrates that with technology, it is possible
in almost any location.
[*1-2-Switch*](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/1-2-Switch-1173186.html)
similarly pulls away from the screen, with the majority of its minigames relying
on what is done physically with the Joy-Con controller and instructing players
to face their opponent directly. It is an effective example of how to apply
technology in a way that does not lock singular players into staring at a
screen. Such examples as these can serve as positive influences in escape room
development.

In summary, technology brings a variety of benefits, from quick resets when used
as part of a puzzle to interesting and reactive ideas that may not otherwise be
possible. Many ideas and inspirations have been discussed here. However, care
must be taken to ensure that if the implementation separates one player from the
group, it is applied in an engaging manner. Escape room maintainers value
reliability, with negative reviews being the consequence for ill implementation
[@liam2019]. The strength of escape rooms as an educational tool has also been
demonstrated here, which is worth consideration when building for the escape
room industry.
