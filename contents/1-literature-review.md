# Literature Survey

## Process
<!-- TODO: how did you go about the lit review? it was a mini-project of its own, after all -->

### Keywords

The following keywords were identified for use in the search. The search was
conducted using the Google Scholar search engine.

- escape room / puzzle hunt
- maintainer / owner / host
- implementation
- software
- virtual reality
- education / classroom

This led to the following searches.

- escape room owner
- escape room host
- escape room maintainer
- escape room software
- escape room education
- escape room classroom
- virtual reality escape room
- portable escape room

Additional searches were made based on discoveries such as escapED
[@clarke2016escaped] and Breakout EDU @breakoutedu to see where they had been
applied.

## Survey

Escape rooms are run both by enthusiasts as solo ventures, and as
franchises across the country. Nicholson [-@nicholson2015peeking] documents
escape rooms as the culmination of a variety of media. He identifies
puzzle hunts as team-based problem-solving challenges<!-- TODO: is this a quote?
-->, which, with treasure hunts, appears most similar to escape rooms. Various
others have lent features to escape rooms, such as immersion in a story as the
"hero", which @duplessie2013go reports as being something enthusiasts enjoy.
This is embodied by live-action roleplaying, another inspiration for the genre
[@nicholson2015peeking]. Nicholson presents the precursors to escape rooms in
further depth in his paper - Figure 2.1 summarises these.

Escape rooms have grown popular in many locations across the world as a
recreational activity [@nicholson2015peeking; @stasiak2016escape], even serving
as a tourist attraction [@dilek2018real]. Nicholson reports that the *Real
Escape Game* by SCRAP was the earliest well-documented activity branded as such.
SCRAP has gone on to develop escape rooms at a much larger scale than the
typical escape room, which serves teams of an average size of 4.58 people
[@nicholson2015peeking].

<!-- General introduction to argument -->

Escape room maintainers are able to apply technology to varying degrees. On the
outside of the escape room experience, maintainers implement leaderboards, share
team photos to social media, and interact with the team via a screen or handheld
transceiver in the room. Inside the room, entire puzzles can be based on
technology, if the maintainer has the necessary expertise. Some more unique
applications within the room are also possible, such as using a hidden camera to
take a photo of the team, apply filters, and display the photo among works of
art as demonstrated in *[The Gallery](https://escapist.nl/en/)* (visited
in July 2019). However, there is a general aversion to the use of technology in
escape rooms, for a variety of reasons. @liam2019 suggests that the time
investment, reliability, and necessary expertise are some of the greatest
contributing factors.

<!-- Reliability Vs. immersion -->

Reliability is one of the strongest factors in an escape room maintainer's
decision to apply technology. Application of technology in escape rooms comes
with some uncertainty, and a break in the flow of the escape room experience can
shatter participants' immersion and lead to negative reviews [@liam2019].
Immersion can be defined as captivating the participant and making them feel
invested in a situation or story. It can be achieved through the use of
theatrics such as special effects, acting, props, and room design.

In his example, @duplessie2013go creates immersion through sound and steam to
cover for his room's rotating mechanic - distracting the participants from this
gives a sense of reality to the situation they are in, immersing them in the
environment and story fully. DuPlessie is critial of digital, rather than
physical, interaction in escape rooms, citing the importance of immersion, and
recommends movement away from what he calls the "glowing rectangles" as our
medium of choice.

<!-- Why physical interaction gets scrapped -->

Physical interaction is often forgone in favour of making escape rooms easy to
reset to their initial state. It can be considered a foundation point of many
escape rooms - 70% of escape rooms employ a search for physical objects as part
of the experience [@nicholson2015peeking]. However, temporary escape rooms,
particularly those used in the classroom, tend to forgo this for various
reasons. In discussing this, the apparent necessity for physical interaction in
escape games can be broken down.

A study by @lopezuse organised its puzzles in a manner whereby puzzles
could be completed in any order, allowing multiple groups to attend the room at
once. One example puzzle given in the study was an exercise likely done on
paper. In this instance, physical interaction and immersion were traded in
favour of allowing multiple groups to attend the room at once. This is important
in the context of education, where the whole class should engage with the
subject matter in the allotted time.

<!-- Visibility -->

@liam2019 highlights that visibility of the puzzle to the entire team should be
a priority. This is particularly an issue if a puzzle requires one person to
work at a computer alone - @nicholson2015peeking warns of the danger of removing
just one player from the "mental space" of the team. Even if a screen-based
puzzle calls for multiple people, the available space and the visibility of the
screen dictates how many members of the group can interact with it. Unless
monitors are suitably placed and large enough to be viewed by a full party, the
whole team may not be able to interface with a puzzle that applies technology. 

A greater number of monitors, or larger monitors that allow for multiple users
to interact with the puzzle (e.g. a multi-touch screen), could both counteract
this. Having said that, these come with both a literal and figurative price -
the cost of the resources themselves, and the space within the escape room in
which they can be implemented. As such, these factors make them difficult to
implement with repeat effectiveness across different escape rooms.

@rouse2017lessons applied the idea of using a computer in the classroom using a
game loaded from a memory stick. This application seems understandable; Rouse's
audience was likely to have some basic level of expertise in, and enthusiasm
for, handling computers as part of the digital native generation. Though never
directly stated, they can be assumed to be under 18. In practice, this
application of technology brings to mind the image of a small group of people
crowding around a screen, embodying a negative example in following this law of
visibility.

<!-- Resets -->

Poor implementation does not necessarily mean technology should not be excluded
from escape room environments outright. Instead, technology has the potential to
inspire change in escape rooms by targetting the time it takes to reset a room
back into a playable state. Escape rooms and technology are inherently linked -
digital escape-the-room games such as *Myst* precede and inspire physical escape
rooms [@nicholson2015peeking]. In these games, partipicants solve similar
puzzles through digital means, sometimes applying and combining an inventory of
objects to create new tools for use in their escape.

These forms of escape room can be reset instantly by resetting the game. Whether
this is done by restarting an attempt, restarting the game, or removing save
files and starting over, it is often trivial compared to how long it takes to
reset escape rooms. @liam2019 explains that resetting physical escape rooms can
often take as long as 15 minutes, and that it is something escape room
maintainers seek to optimise; the shorter a reset takes, the more time is
available to welcome customers.

Quick resets are a priority in many different situations. Tuzak develops
portable escape games that are run in shopping centres [@gunduz2018preventing] -
the move to shopping centres, made as part of their blue ocean strategy, was
likely chosen in an effort to capture new customers, making it all the more
important that the room could be reset quickly. Several studies cover the use of
escape rooms as a means for education [@lopezuse; @rouse2017lessons;
@peleg2019lab; @beguin2019computer] In particular, the previously-mentioned
application by @lopezuse allowed multiple groups to tackle the escape rooms at
the same time by removing the need to reset puzzles entirely.

<!-- VR -->

@liam2019 theorises that virtual reality (VR) escape rooms such as *[EXIT
VR](https://exit-vr.de/en/)* may be the next stage for the industry, which allow
immersive rooms to be created while effectively eliminating the issue of
resetting the room as above. This would bring the escape room cycle full circle,
reincarnating the modern wave of physical escape rooms in the digital form that
inspired them.

@pendit2017virtual exercised this in the creation of their
virtual escape room *The Last Breakout*. This application revealed some
potential caveats that may be visible in the creation of VR escape rooms. Unreal
Engine 4 assisted in making the project feasible, but limited knowledge of how
to use it resulted in difficulties. These included motion sickness from
excessive movement, user experience as regards knowing when they might have
picked up an object, and display of reading materials [@pendit2017virtual].

These could be remedied with more effective VR development experience, but user
interface issues remain something that cannot be tackled without the correct
principles. In a study by @smith2009using, it was found that the context of
virtual reality clouded the line between a video game and a simulation of
reality - one child reportedly asked "How do I kneel?" when inside the
simulation. This misunderstanding could be attributed to how crouching in video
games works - it is most often toggled by, or activated by holding, a button
input. While @smith2009using acknowledges the "built-in capability for higher
levels of actual human–computer interaction than traditional video games", this
boundary should not be ignored.

While the escape room industry cautiously explores the "glowing rectangles"
@duplessie2013go warns against, the video games industry that lent it
inspiration sometimes takes small strides to recede from them. This has resulted
in concepts that escape rooms, and interactive experiences of all kinds, can
learn from. [*Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes*](https://keeptalkinggame.com/)
focuses on asynchronous gameplay, in which one player must defuse a bomb while
the others guide them using the [bomb's manual](https://bombmanual.com).
Conceptually, the game shares fundamentals with escape rooms, but what is of
most importance to the point is that the foremost task in the game is
communication. Escape rooms already apply asynchronous gameplay - The Lockup
Escape Rooms' *Meltdown* [@liam2019] begins with most of the party in individual
chambers, with the designated 'leader' communicating from outside - but *Keep
Talking and Nobody Explodes* demonstrates that with technology, it is possible
in almost any location.
[*1-2-Switch*](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/1-2-Switch-1173186.html)
similarly pulls away from the screen, with the majority of its minigames relying
on what is done physically with the Joy-Con controller and instructing players
to face their opponent directly. It is an effective example of how to apply
technology in a way that does not lock singular players into staring at a
screen. Such examples as these can serve as positive influences in escape room
development.

In summary, technology brings a variety of benefits, from quick resets when used
as part of a puzzle to interesting and reactive ideas that may not otherwise be
possible. Many ideas and inspirations have been discussed here. The strength of
escape rooms as an educational tool has also been demonstrated here, which is
worth consideration when building for the escape room industry. However, there
is a debate as to whether the use of technology in escape rooms is always a
viable option. Escape room maintainers value reliability, with negative reviews
being the consequence for ill implementation [@liam2019]. One of the greatest
points of contention is immersion. Care must be taken to ensure that if the
implementation separates one player from the group, it is applied in an engaging
manner. Excessive reliance upon screens is something that should be avoided in
the name of immersion.

It is clear that a balance should be maintained between these factors, and as
such, it is difficult to approach a one-size-fits-all solution for use inside an
escape room. However, it is clear that technology can advance escape rooms with
careful implementation. In particular, it can be used outside of the experience
itself in matters such as booking rooms, keeping a leaderboard, or advertising
through social media or otherwise. This research goes on to define the latter of
these as a feature of interest to maintainers, particularly when technology is
applied.
