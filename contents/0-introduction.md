# Introduction

<!--
- set the scene for the project by giving a little relevant background information - try to grab the reader's interest early
- clearly elucidate the aims and objectives of the project and the constraints that might affect the way in which the project is carried out. If the project involves the solution of a specific problem or the production of a specific system this should be clearly specified in an informal way
- summarise the remaining chapters of the report, in effect giving the reader an overview of what is to come

The aim of this project is to build tested tools to meet the needs of escape 
room maintainers. Research will be focused towards exploring the needs of escape
room maintainers, such that a product can be designed and built to target some
subset of these needs. These needs may be related to various issues - such as 
making sure a timer is visible to the group, or to processes that currently take
more time than necessary, such as posting photos of teams to social media 
[@liam2019].
<!-- TODO: Need to rejig now I know what I'm doing -->

In order to guide the focus of my project, I will use this paper to identify and
discuss the features of escape rooms and their implementation across existing
publications. I intend to do so guided by my chosen research questions. This is 
expected to reveal requirements for developing tools for escape room maintainers
across industries.

## Research Questions

I have identified two research questions, which this stage of the project will be focused towards answering:

**RQ1**: What has been reported about concepts used in escape rooms applied in different environments?   
**RQ2**: Based on this, what can we establish as the requirements for escape games, independent of their environment?
