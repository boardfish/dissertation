# Design

<!--
This should explain the design technique chosen (and justify why it is
appropriate) from the various ones available; it should select a suitable subset
of the things described in the analysis chapter and develop a design. Where
trade-offs exist between different designs, the chosen approach should be
justified. Suitable diagram-techniques (e.g. UML, other drawings) should be used
where appropriate. If a method is applied selectively, explain which parts were
used and why. Experimental projects should pay careful attention to control
conditions, samples selected, etc. to ensure a valid result.
