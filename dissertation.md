<!-- Abstract -->
<!--
This should be two or three short paragraphs (100-150 words total), summarising
the dissertation. It is important that this is not just a restatement of the
original project outline. A suggested flow is background, project aims and main
achievements. A bad abstract would have a final paragraph that just said "the
achievements will be described" - this is useless, as it says nothing. From the
abstract a reader should be able to ascertain if the project is of interest to
them and presents results of which they would like to know more details.

### Abstract

<!-- - explain topic -->
Escape rooms are physical, interactive experiences in which a group of
participants must solve puzzles to escape a locked room, solve a mystery, or
otherwise meet some goal in a particular timespan.
<!-- - explain content -->
This project aimed to build a tool primarily to serve the needs of escape room
maintainers. Though the original brief expressed intent to craft a networked
solution for use within the escape room itself, research and scope changed this
focus. Instead, a web application was developed as a social network between
escape room maintainers and enthusiasts.
<!-- - explain highlights -->
The final product is built with industry-standard knowledge, principles, tools
and best practices amassed during the degree programme. 
<!-- - explain purpose of paper -->
This dissertation paper serves to document, and justify decisions made along,
the process of development of this product.
