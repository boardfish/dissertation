<!-- Abstract -->
<!-- This should be two or three short paragraphs (100-150 words total), summarising the dissertation. It is important that this is not just a restatement of the original project outline. A suggested flow is background, project aims and main achievements. A bad abstract would have a final paragraph that just said "the achievements will be described" - this is useless, as it says nothing. From the abstract a reader should be able to ascertain if the project is of interest to them and presents results of which they would like to know more details. -->
### Abstract

<!-- - explain topic -->
Escape rooms are physical, interactive experiences in which a group of participants must solve puzzles to escape a locked room, solve a mystery, or otherwise meet some goal in a particular timespan.
<!-- - explain content -->
This report uses various studies into applications of escape rooms to discuss the priorities of well-made escape games, particularly with regards to the inclusion of technology. It also marks my current progress in research into my dissertation topic as expressed in the title.
<!-- - explain highlights -->
It focuses on the difficulties in applying technology in escape rooms and 
priorities that should be held in order to mitigate these.
<!-- - explain purpose of paper -->
On this basis, it serves to document universal requirements to bear in mind when
developing hardware or software for escape rooms.
