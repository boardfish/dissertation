// Explains origins of escape rooms and possible inspiration
// Mentions puzzle hunts - perhaps this is where the focus should be?
// Interactive theater - could introduce elements of this by making a preset block for recorded footage and associated text
// Draw of technology - creating an engine means we can get the IP and license it out selectively! Appetising to escape rooms because they have a guarantee that others can't copy without major repercussion.
// page 10 = table shows that market has yet to grow here
// Should look at catering for 4-5 people
// Themes - should really be an afterthought, but I've got an idea - one player getting into costume and striking a pose to 'reawaken a legend'?
// Agrees with open/sequential/path-based from wiemker2015escape
// Good ideas at end of page 17
// Page 20 - concept of computers in rooms is familiar but detracts from experience. Need to focus towards experiences that aren't focused on the screen, like 1-2-Switch.
// Matt DuPlessie tedx talk - pull away from the 'glowing rectangles', create a sense of challenge and heroism
