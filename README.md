# Building a Platform for the Escape Game Community

This is the source code for my dissertation paper, which documents and justifies my approach to building software for the escape game community. It's written in Markdown with bits of LaTeX and Pandoc-flavoured Markdown sprinkled in.

## Requirements

`pandoc`, `pandoc-citeproc`, and a LaTeX installation (e.g. with the `texlive-full` package from Ubuntu repositories) are required. You should then be able to run `scripts/build` in a POSIX-standard shell (bash, etc.) to build the dissertation paper to `output.pdf`.
